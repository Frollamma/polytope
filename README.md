# polytope

polytope is a tool to generate BIP-44 compatible wallets completely offline and with flexible settings. Think of it as a CLI that emulates an hardware wallet.

- polytope doesn't store any wallet information on disk, everything is printed on screen
- polytope tries to keep things simple, for now it's just one script, you can check its code in less than 5 minutes
- polytope has a cool name, [check Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope) for more
